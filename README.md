# Pocket Groove

**Pocket Groove** is a single-file (`index.html`) browser-based mini groovebox
and 16-step sequencer built with the **Web Audio API**.

It is designed as a lightweight experimental playground for
minimal patterns, essential grooves, and touch-first workflows.

No build system.  
No external dependencies.  
Everything lives in one HTML file.
